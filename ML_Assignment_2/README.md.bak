# ML Assignment 2 - Loan Default Prediction (Lending Club)

## a) Problem statement
Build multiple classification models to predict whether a loan will default (Charged Off) or not (Fully Paid).
Also create a Streamlit app to demo model selection + metrics.

## b) Dataset description
Dataset: Lending Club loan data (2007-2014)
File used: `loan_data_2007_2014_New.csv`
Target:
- Fully Paid -> 0
- Charged Off -> 1
We removed other loan_status values like Current etc.

Min requirements (from assignment): >=12 features and >=500 rows (this dataset satisfies after cleaning).

## c) Models used + Metrics table
Models (6):
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. KNN
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
5. Random Forest
6. XGBoost

Metrics calculated:
Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1, MCC

After running `train_models.py`, the table is saved at:
`saved_models/metrics_table.csv`

(put the table here in final submission by copying the printed output or csv)

| ML Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Decision Tree |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| KNN |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Naive Bayes |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Random Forest |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| XGBoost |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Observations (add after you see results)
| ML Model | Observation about performance |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | baseline, interpretable, needs scaling |
| Decision Tree | can overfit, unstable |
| KNN | depends on scaling and k |
| Naive Bayes | fast but independence assumption |
| Random Forest | usually strong, less overfit |
| XGBoost | often best AUC, needs tuning |

## How to run (BITS Lab)
1) Put `loan_data_2007_2014_New.csv` in the same folder as `train_models.py`
2) Install deps:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Train + save models:
```
python train_models.py
```
4) Run Streamlit:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Links for submission (fill before final PDF)
- GitHub Repo Link: <paste here>
- Streamlit App Link: <paste here>

Notes:
- Streamlit upload should be test data only (small) because free tier is limited.
- For app metrics, include a `target` column in the uploaded CSV.
