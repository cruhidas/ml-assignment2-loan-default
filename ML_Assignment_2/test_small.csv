The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems. It is also worth noting that I share my condo, so mortgage and bills are split, giving me a comfortable buffer in my disposable income to cover payments on this loan without any adverse affects.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br>",major_purchase,Loan Payoff and Home Improvement,112xx,NY,2.21,0.0,May-06,2.0,,,9.0,0.0,2217,18.8,13.0,f,0.0,0.0,15808.02,15808.02,14050.0,1758.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-13,5569.67,,Dec-13,0.0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
